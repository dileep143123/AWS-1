# **ElastiCache for Solution Architects.**

## **Cache Security.**

* All caches in ElastiCache:
    * Do not support IAM authentication.
    * IAM polocies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API-level security.
* Redis AUTH:
    * You can set a password/token when you create a Redis cluster.
    * This is an extra level of security for your cache (on top of security groups).
    * Supports SSL in flight encryption.
* Memcached:
    * Supports SASL-based authentication which is quite advanced.

## **Patterns for ElastiCache.**

There are 3 types of patterns for loading into ElastiCache:

* **Lazy Loading** - all read data is cached, data inside the cache can become stale.
* **Write Through** - adds or updates data in the cache when written to a DB (no stale data).
* **Session Store** - store temporary session data in a cache (using TTL features).

Note that it is widely accepted that caching & cache invalidation are extremely hard/difficult practices.

## **Redis use cases.**

Gaming leaderboards are computationally complex...

* **Redis Sorted Sets** guarantee both uniqueness and element ordering.
* Each time a new element is added, it's ranked in real-time, then added in the correct order.
