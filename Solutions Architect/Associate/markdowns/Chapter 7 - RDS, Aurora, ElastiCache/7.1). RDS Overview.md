# **RDS Overview.**

* RDS stands for Relational Database Service.
* It's a managed database service for databases that use SQL as a query language.
* It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS.
* What type of databases does RDS support?
    * Postgres (think redshift).
    * MySQL.
    * MariaDB.
    * Oracle.
    * Microsoft SQL Server.
    * Aurora (AWS Proprietary database).

## **RDS vs Deploying a Database on EC2.**

* RDS is a managed service:
    * Automated provisioning, OS patching.
    * Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore).
    * Monitoring dashboards.
    * Read replicas for improved read performance. 
    * Multi AZ setup for Disaster Recovery.
    * Maintenance windows for upgrades.
    * Scaling capability (both vertical and horizontal).
    * Storage backup by EBS (gp2 or io1).
* **BUT we cannot SSH into our underlying EC2 instances.** 

## **RDS Backups.**

* Backups are automatically enabled in RDS.
* Automated backups:
    * Daily full backup of the database (during the maintenance window).
    * Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes.
    * This gives us the ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 mins ago).
    * 7 day retention (can be increased to 35 days).
* DB Snapshots:
    * Manually triggered by the user.
    * Retention of backup for as long as you want.

## **RDS - Storage Auto Scaling.\***

* Helps you increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically.
* When RDS detects you are running our of free database storage it will scale automatically.
* Avoid manually scaling your database storage.
* You have to set **Maximum Storage Threshold** (maximum limit for DB storage).
* Automatically modify storage if:
    * Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage.
    * Low storage lasts at least 5 minutes.
    * 6 hours have passed since last modification.
* Useful for applications with **unpredictable workloads**.
* Supports all RDS database engines (MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle).
