# **Netwrok Load Balancer.**

Network load balancers (layer 4) allow the following:
* Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances.
* Handle millions of requests per second.
* Less latency (~100ms) (vs 400 ms for Application Load Balancers).

**Network Load Balancers have one static IP per AZ and support assigning Elastic IP. This is helpful for whitelisting specific IPs.**

The use case for Network Load Balancers are the following:

* These are used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic.
* Not included in the AWS free tier.

## **Target Groups.**

* EC2 Instances.
* IP Adresses - must be private IPs.
* Application Load Balancer (chaining two load balancers together) - why would we want to do this? Maybe we want to leverage a fixed static IP for private networks but want to leverage all of an Application Load Balancer's connectivity features over HTTP / HTTPs.
