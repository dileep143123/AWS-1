# **Sticky Sessions (or Session Affinity).**

It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind the load balancer.

**This works for Classic Load Balancers & Application Load Balancers.**

* This is done by assigning a "cookie" to the client / user which can have an expiration date or period.
* The use case for Session Affinity is to ensure that the user doesn't lose their session data.
* Enabling stickiness can potentially bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances.

## **Cookies.**

There are two types of cookies:

* **Application-based Cookie**:
    * We can create a custom cookie:
        * This is generated by the application.
        * Can include any custom attributes required by the application.
        * Cookie name must be specified individually for each target group.
        * We cannot use the following names: AWSALB, AWSALBAPP or AWSALBTG as these are reserved for use by the ELB.
    * We can create a general application cookie:
        * This is generated by the load balancer itself.
        * This will be called **AWSALBAPP**.
* **Duration-based Cookies**:
    * Cookie is generated by the load balancer.
    * Cookie is called **AWSALB** for a ALB & **AWSELB** for a CLB.
