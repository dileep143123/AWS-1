# **Routing Policies.**

* Used to define how Route 53 responds to DNS queries.
* We need to not get confused by the word "Routing":
    * It's not the same as Load Balancer routing which routes traffic to EC2 instances.
    * DNS does not route any traffic, it only responds to DNS queries, this is what we route.
* Route 53 supports the following Routing Policies:
    * Simple.
    * Weighted.
    * Failover.
    * Latency Based.
    * Geolocation.
    * Multi-Value Answer.
    * Geoproximity (using the Route 53 Traffic Flow feature).

## **Simple Routing Policy.**

* Typically, we only route traffic to a single resource.
* Can specify multiple values in the same record.
* If multiple values are returned, a random one is chosen by the **client**.
* When Alias is enabled, specify only one AWS resource.
* Can't be associated with Health Checks.
