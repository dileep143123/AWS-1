# **Domain Registrar vs DNS Service.**

* You can buy or register your domain name with a Domain Registrar typically by paying annual charges (e.g. GoDaddy, Amazon Registrar etc.).
* The Domain registrar usually provides you with a DNS service to manage your DNS records.
* However, you can use another DNS service to manage your DNS records.
* For example, you can purchase your domain from GoDaddy but use AWS Route 53 to manage your DNS records.

## **Using GoDaddy with Route 53.**

* Once you have registered your domain with GoDaddy, there will be a "Nameservers" section.
* Once we have created a public hosted zone on AWS Route 53, you will also be able to see "Nameservers".
* You will need to paste the Nameservers from Route 53 into the GoDaddy Nameservers.
