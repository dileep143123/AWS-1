# **Routing Policies - Failover.**

* We will assign a mandatory health check to our primary record (or EC2 instance / resource).
* If our health check becomes unhealthy, then Route 53 will failover to our secondary / disaster recovery instance.
* The failover resource can also have an associated health check, however, there can only be one primary health check for the primary resource.
* DNS Requests will thus only get the response of a healthy record / resource.
