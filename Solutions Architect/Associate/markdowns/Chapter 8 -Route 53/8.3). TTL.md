# **TTL.**

TTL stands for ***Time To Live***.

Let's compare some extreme cases:

* High TTL (e.g. 24 hours):
    * Less traffic on Route 53.
    * Possibly outdated records if they're updated (i.e. we would have to wait at least 24 hours before all of our clients noticed the change).
* Low TTL (e.g. 60 seconds):
    * More traffic on Route 53 (& hence higher cost).
    * Records are outdated for less time if we want to update them.
    * Easy to change DNS records.
* TTL is mandatory for every possible record bar the **Alias** record.
