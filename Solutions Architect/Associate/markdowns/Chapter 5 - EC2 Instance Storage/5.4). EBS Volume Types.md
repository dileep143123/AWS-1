# **EBS Volume Types.**

* EBS Volumes come is 6 types.
    * **gp2 / gp3 (SSD)** - general purpose SSD volumes that balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads.
    * **io1 / io2 (SSD)** - highest performance SSD volume for mission-critical low-latency or high-throughput workloads.
    * **st1 (HDD)** - low cost HDD volume designed for frequently avvessed, throughput intensive workloads.
    * **sc1 (HDD)** - lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads.

* EBS Volumes are characterised in:
    * Size.
    * Throughput.
    * IOPS (I/O Operations per Sec).

* **Only gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 can be used as boot volumes.**
