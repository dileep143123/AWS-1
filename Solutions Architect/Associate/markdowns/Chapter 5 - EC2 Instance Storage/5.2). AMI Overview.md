# **AMI.**

AMI stands for ***Amazon Machine Image***.

* AMI's are a customisation of an EC2 instance.
    * You can add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring etc.
    * Using our own AMI's will result in a faster boot / configuration time for our EC2 instances because all of our software will be pre-packaged.
* AMI's are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions).
* You can launch EC2 instances using:
    * **A Public AMI** - these are provided by AWS & are what we've been using thus far (i.e. AWS Linux 2 AMI).
    * **A Customisable AMI** - meaning we have to make & maintain ourself.
    * **An AWS Marketplace AMI** - an AMI someone else made (& potentially sells).

## **AMI Process.**

* Start an EC2 instance and customise it.
* Stop the instance (to prevent data loss & data integrity).
* Build an AMI - this will also create EBS snapshots.
* Launch instances from other AMIs.
