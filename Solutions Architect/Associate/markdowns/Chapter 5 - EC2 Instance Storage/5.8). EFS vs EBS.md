# **EFS vs EBS.**

Here is a summary of the differences between the two:

* EBS Volumes:
    * Can only be attached to one instance at a time.
    * These are also locked to a specific AZ.
    * Storage size needs to be provisioned.
    * gp2 - the IO will increase as the disk size increases.
    * io1 - can increase IO independently from disk size (good for DBs).
    * To migrate our EBS volume across AZ's we need to take a snapshot.
    * Take snapshot -> Restore snapshot to another AZ.
    * EBS backups use IO and you shouldn't run them whilst your application is handling a lot of traffic.
    * By default, your EBS root volumes get terminated if you EC2 instance gets terminated (which can be changed).

* EFS Volumes:
    * Can be mounted to hundreds or thousands of instances across AZ's.
    * These are run on Linux (POSIX) only AMI's.
    * This can be used to share website files.
    * EFS has a higher price point than EBS (on a cost per use basis).
    * Can leverage EFS-IA for cost savings.
