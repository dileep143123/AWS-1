# **EBS Multi-Attach.**

This is for the io1/io2 family ONLY.

This feature allows us to attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances within the same AZ.

Each EC2 instance has full read and write permissions to the volume.

Use cases:
* Achieve higher application availability in clustered Linux applications (e.g. Teradata).
* Applications must be able to manage concurrent write operations.

This also means that your applications must use a file system that is **cluster aware**.
