# **EFS Overview.**

EFS stands for Elastic File System.

* This is a managed network file system (NFS) that can be mounted on many EC2 instances.
* EFS works with EC2 instances in multiple AZ's.
* Highly available, scalable, expensive (3 x gp2), pay per use.

EFS has the following use cases:
* Content management, web serving, data sharing & wordpress.
* Uses NFSv4.1 protocol.
* Uses security groups to control access to EFS.
* Compatible with linux based AMIs - not Windows.
* Encryption at rest using KMS.
* EFS is used for only POSIX file systems (i.e. Linux) that has a standard file API.
* The file system scaled automatically, pay-per-use & no capacity planning.

## **Performance and storage classes.**

* Scale:
    * 1000s of concurrent NFS clients, 10 GB+/s throughput.
    * Grow to petabyte-scale network file system automatically.
* Performance mode:
    * General purpose (default): latency-sensitive use cases (web server, CMS, etc.).
    * Max I/O - higher latency, throughput & highly parallel (big data, media processing).
* Throughput mode:
    * Bursting (1 TB = 50 MiB/s + burst of up to 100 MiB/s).
    * Provisioned - set your throughput regardless of storage size. e.g. 1 GiB/s for 1 TB storage.
* Storage tiers (lifecycle management feature - move file after N days):
    * Standard - for frequently accessed files.
    * Infrequent access (EFS-IA) - cost to retrieve files, lower price to store.
