# **EC2 Instance Store.**

* EBS volumes are **network drives** with good but "limited" performance.
* **If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store.**

EC2 Instance Stores are physical hard drives attached to the physical server where the EC2 Instance is. This can result in:

* Better I/O performance.
* EC2 Instance Stores lose their storage if they're terminated (this is know as an ephemeral storage type).
* Use case - this type of storage is good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content.

**For long term storage, do not consider using EC2 Instance Storage. EBS Volumes are much better for this.** 

There is also the risk of **data loss if the underling hardware hosting the Instance Store fails.**

This means that backup and replication are entirely our responsibility.
