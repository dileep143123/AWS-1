# **EBS Encryption.**

When you create and encrypted EBS volume, you get the following:
* Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume.
* All the data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted.
* All snapshots are encrypted.
* All volumes created from the snapshot are also encrypted.

### **Important points.\***

* All encryption and decryption is handled transparently (we have nothing to do).
* **Encryption has a minimal impact on latency.**
* EBS encryption leverages keys from KMS (using AES-256).
* Copying an unencrypted snapshot allows encryption.
* Snapshots of encrypted volumes are also encrypted.

### **Encrypt an unencrypted EBS volume.**

* Create an EBS snapshot of the volume.
* Encrypt the EBS snapshot using the copy.
* Create new EBS volume from the snapshot that will also be encrypted.
* Now you can attach the encrypted volume to the original instance.

(You can also just tick the encryption option inside the console).
