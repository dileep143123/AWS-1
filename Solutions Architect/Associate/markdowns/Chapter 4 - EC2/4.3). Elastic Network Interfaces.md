# **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI).**

ENI's are logical components in a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) that represent a **virtual network card**.

Each ENI can have the following attributes:

* Primary private IPv4 address, one or more secondary IPv4 addresses.
* One Elastic IPv4 per private IPv4.
* One public IPv4.
* One or more security groups.
* A MAC address.

You can create ENI's independently from EC2 instances and attach them on the fly on EC2 instances for failover. ENI's are bound to a specific availability zone.

**This is extremely beneficial to ensure network failover.**

Failover is a backup operational mode that automatically switches to a standby database, server or network if the primary system fails, or is shut down for servicing. Failover is an extremely important function for critical systems that require always-on accessibility.
