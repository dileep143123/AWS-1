# **Instance Types.**

* You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for different use cases (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).

AWS has the following naming convention:

**m5.2xlarge**

**m**: Instance Class.
**5**: Generation (over time, this may move to 6 per say.)
**2xlarge**: Size within the instance class.

## **General Purpose Instance Types.\***

General purpose instance types have the following advantages & use cases:

* **Great for diversity of workloads** - such as web servers or code repositories.
* They will have a good balance between:
    * **Compute.**
    * **Memory.**
    * **Networking.**
* In this course we will be using the *t2.micro* which is a general purpose EC2 instance.

## **Compute Optimized Instance Types.\***

Compute optimized instance types have the following advantages & use cases:

* **Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors** - examples include:
    * Batch processing workloads.
    * Media transcoding.
    * High performance web servers.
    * High performance computing (HPC).
    * Machine learning & scientific modelling.
    * Dedicated gaming servers.

## **Memory Optimized Instance Types.\***

Memory optimized instance types have the following advantages & use cases:

* **Fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory** - examples include:
    * High performance, relational & non-relational databases.
    * Distributed web scale cache stores.
    * In-memory databases optimized for BI.
    * Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data.

## **Storage Optimized Instance Types.\***

Storage optimized instance types have the following advantages & use cases:

* **Great for storage-intensive tasks** - tasks that require high, sequential read & write access to large data sets on local storage:

    * High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
    * Relational & NoSQL databases.
    * Cache for in-memory databases such as Redis.
    * Data warehousing applications.
    * Distributed file systems.
