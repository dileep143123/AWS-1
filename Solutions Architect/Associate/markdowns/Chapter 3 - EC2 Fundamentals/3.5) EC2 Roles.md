# **EC2 Instance Roles.**

**It is extremely bad practice to run AWS Configure with our own Access/Secret Access keys inside the VM.**

Why?

Well, if we were to configure our aws within our VM, anyone else with access to the root account could login to our VM & retreive our personal credentials.

**Instead, you should attach IAM roles with the sufficient permissions, onto the EC2 instance.**

This can be done by:

Actions -> Security -> Modify IAM Role -> Attach IAM Role.

We can then authenticate (providing we have list permissions on our IAM role) inside the VM by using:

```
aws iam list-users
```
& we should see our user.
