# **IAM Best Practices.**

Below are some IAM best practices to avoid problems or headaches further down the line:

* Don't use the root account for anything other than AWS account setup.
* One physical user = One AWS user.
* **Assign users to groups** & assign permissions to groups.
* Create a strong **password policy**.
* Use & enforce the use of **MFA**.
* Create & use **Roles** for giving permissions to AWS services.
* Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access such as when using the CLI or an SDK.
* Audit permissions of your account with the IAM Credentials Report.
* **Never share IAM users or Access Keys.**
