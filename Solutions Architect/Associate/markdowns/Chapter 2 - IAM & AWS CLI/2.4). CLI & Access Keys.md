# **AWS CLI & Access Keys.**

To access AWS, you have 3 different options:

* **AWS Management Console** - protected by password + MFA.
* **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)** - protected by access keys.
* **AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK)** - protected by access keys.

Some Key Points:

* Access Keys are generated through the AWS Console.
* Users manage their own access keys.
* ***Access Keys are secret (just like a password) - don't share them!***
* Access Key ID != username.
* Secret Access Key ID != password.

## **AWS CLI.**

The AWS CLI is a tool that enables you to access & interact AWS services using the command-line shell (i.e. terminal, bash, zsh etc.).

What are some of it's benefits?

* Gives you direct access to the public APIs of the AWS services.
* You can develop scripts to manage your resources.
* It's open-source at https://github.com/aws/aws-cli.
* Alternative to using the AWS management console.

## **AWS SDK.**

The SDK stands for Software Development Kit, these are a set of language-specific libraries to help you acess & manage AWS services programmatically.

The AWS SDK is **embedded within your application** & has support for Javascript, Python, PHP, NET, Ruby, Java, Go, Node.js, C++.

The AWS CLI is built on the the AWS SDK for Python (boto!).
