# **IAM.**

## **Users & Groups.**

* IAM stands for Identity & Access Management.
* IAM is a global service.
* A Root account is created by default (when we sign up), but shouldn't be used or shared.
* Users are people within your organisation & can be grouped.
* Groups can only contain users, not other groups.
* Users don't have to belong to a group, a user can also belong to multiple groups.

## **Permissions.**

* Users or Groups can be assigned .json documents called policies.
* These policies outline the Users / Groups permissions.
* In AWS it is important to apply the least privelege principle, don't give more permissions than a user needs.
