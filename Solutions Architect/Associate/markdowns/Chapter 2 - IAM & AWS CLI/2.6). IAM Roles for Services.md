# **IAM Roles for Services.**

Some AWS services will need to perform actions on your behalf. To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM roles.

e.g.

EC2 Instance may want perform some actions within AWS, in order to do this, we will  assume an IAM role to the EC2 Instance.

Some common IAM roles include:

* IAM user in another account.
* Application code running on an EC2 instance that needs to perform actions on AWS services.
* Lambda function roles.
* Roles for CloudFormation.

***IAM roles are a secure way to grant permissions to entities that you trust.***

## **IAM Security Tools.**

* IAM Credentials Report (Account Level).
    * A report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials.
* IAM Access Advisor (User Level).
    * Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
    * You can use this information to revise your policies.
