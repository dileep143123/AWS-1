# **IAM Roles for Services.**

Some AWS services will need to perform actions on your behalf. To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM roles.

e.g.

EC2 Instance may want perform some actions within AWS, in order to do this, we will  assume an IAM role to the EC2 Instance.

Some common IAM roles include:

* IAM user in another account.
* Application code running on an EC2 instance that needs to perform actions on AWS services.
* Lambda function roles.
* Roles for CloudFormation.

**IAM roles are a secure way to grant permissions to entities that you trust.**
