# **Policies.**

## **Policy Inheritance.**

If we assign a policy to a group, users of that group will inherit the policy of that group.

We can assign something called an **in-line** policy to users that do not sit in any of our groups.

If users belong to two groups, then they will inherit **both policies** from the groups they sit in.

An example of a policy document can be seen below:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17", 
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow", 
            "Action": "ec2:Describe*", 
            "Resource": "*"
        }, 
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:ListMetrics", 
                "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics", 
                "cloudwatch:Describe*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Where this policy allows the Group & all it's Users to use the listed services & features.
