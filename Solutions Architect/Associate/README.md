## Solutions Architect Associate

My first aim will be to become AWS certified as a solutions associate. I aim to use the following resources:

* **Udemy Courses**  
I will be using the following Udemy Course as material:<br>
https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=Webindex_Catchall_la.EN_cc.UK&utm_term=_._ag_114213220700_._ad_532713168385_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-841699837383_._li_9044965_._pd__._&matchtype=b&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIptjEs8i48wIVVeztCh1ffQg8EAAYASAAEgIOgvD_BwE <br>
This will be my main learning resource as it will utilise the AWS Free-Tier for hands-on learning.

* **Percipio**  
Percipio has been provided by my company as an additional resource. Similar to aCloudGuru. I will try to utilise this as much as possible & to fill the gaps if I deem necessary.
